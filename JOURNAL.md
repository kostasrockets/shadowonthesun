## 10/20/2025 - Static Fire  

Before I created this project on Hack Club, I already worked on this project quite a bit. I designed and built a 2" composite case based off of @tsbooska on TRF's Black Stallion design. ![586867-52866e784e52bdfc78d7e0ba7ca3a7c5.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzkyNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--43c4a77de9916b7c7cbf338fccdf45cd0e2386ba/586867-52866e784e52bdfc78d7e0ba7ca3a7c5.png)

^ Black Stallion

I calculated the hoop stress and epoxy bond lengths, and settled on 4 layers of carbon fiber sleeve. It has a safety factor of 3.67 on both ends

^ Casing Design Spreadsheet

I laid up the casing using molds that would fit into the phenolic motor liner, and put a layer of peel ply over the layup.

^ Casing Layups

I bonded fins to this rocket with the intent of flying it, but after bonding the nozzle and forward closure, didn't feel safe flying it. 

I fired it this saturday, and had a succesful firing. I cut it in half today and saw all the internals, what a cool IRL section view.

I could easily write ~500 words about this motor, and I'll likely elaborate on it in future journal entries. If anyone reading has any questions, my discord is 'onshape', feel free to ask questions.
