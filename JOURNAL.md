## 10/20/2025 8 PM - Static Fire  

Before I created this project on Hack Club, I already worked on this project quite a bit. I designed and built a 2" composite case based off of @tsbooska on TRF's Black Stallion design. ![586867-52866e784e52bdfc78d7e0ba7ca3a7c5.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzkyNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--43c4a77de9916b7c7cbf338fccdf45cd0e2386ba/586867-52866e784e52bdfc78d7e0ba7ca3a7c5.png)

^ Black Stallion

I calculated the hoop stress and epoxy bond lengths, and settled on 4 layers of carbon fiber sleeve. It has a safety factor of 3.67 on both ends

^ Casing Design Spreadsheet

I laid up the casing using molds that would fit into the phenolic motor liner, and put a layer of peel ply over the layup.

I bonded fins to this rocket with the intent of flying it, but after bonding the nozzle and forward closure, didn't feel safe flying it. 

I fired it this saturday, and had a succesful firing. I cut it in half today and saw all the internals, what a cool IRL section view. 

![IMG_9903.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzkzMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f22025fbad52227dbbcfb3ac63089f16bbc5640a/IMG_9903.jpg)

I could easily write ~500 words about this motor, and I'll likely elaborate on it in future journal entries. If anyone reading has any questions, my discord is 'onshape', feel free to ask.
  

## 10/20/2025 9 PM - Simulations (just the start)  

I started doing some simulations on the rocket. (again before I created the project)

Did some preliminary motor design based off of other PropX motors that have worked. Knowing what I've learned from the previous composite case and what has worked + prior art, I defined my requirements as such:

1. Short burn time
2. High average thrust 
3. Reasonable mass flux
4. Reasonable pressure (~800psi)
5. Descending mass flux with grains (I actually forgot why to do this, something about erosivity)
6. Core sizes = drill sizes

I settled on this design:
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzk0MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6008161d76f39fbbac79f1dc2af9f0e07958e226/image.png)

The motor is a monolithic conical geometry, with all the ends being inhibited with epoxy or urethane adhesive. (I will figure this out with some more research)

I did a first sim in OpenRocket, which is somewhat accurate at supersonic, but not great.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzk1MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--abda7cda70dffb2a1ad934c5011d4f69e2e1670a/image.png)

I then did a sim with RASAERO, which resulted in slightly higher Mach but lower Altitude than OpenRocket.

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzk1NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e69436b7ab18d45307a6769f7d449d54109ed37f/image.png)

Additionally, with RASAERO, I determined the CNalpha of the rocket, which is an important (but rather arbitrary) measure of stability. Keeping it >10 has never failed me in past flights

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzk1NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--49c68881611dcd0871fc3914f335dd2d207edd28/image.png)

In these preliminary sims, I have a vehicle mass fraction of 55%, and with some spicier motor configs, I get it to 67%. 


  

## 10/23/2025 - Did first pass CAD  

I spent a pretty long time doing the first pass of the CAD as well as updating sims. 

The first change I made was creating fins with more of a 1:1 aspect ratio (more sounding rocket like, see MORABA rockets & Black Brant), in theory better for high mach flight and stability in general (hoping for a perfectly straight boost). It's worse for performance, as more fin sweep is theoretically better in sims, but because of aerodynamic stuff I honestly don't understand, a fin like this should be more effective at higher mach.

After these changes, I actually cadded the rocket finally. I did it in pretty much one sitting, I was bored.

## Vehicle Info 
![00 - Shadow on the Sun - Main.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTAyMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--51e9645c18c79c79af009256e0582f07a7f050f2/00%20-%20Shadow%20on%20the%20Sun%20-%20Main.png)
![00 - Shadow on the Sun - Main(1).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTAyNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--832cef472e53d552c833972968f3090bfb2da73d/00%20-%20Shadow%20on%20the%20Sun%20-%20Main(1).png)

The vehicle mass fraction in CAD is 53%, about 1% off of the sims. 

### Motor

![03 - Casing(13).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTAyMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--da01d5a83882db929ac5bfc8c81142ce90f6661b/03%20-%20Casing(13).png)

The motor is primarily out of carbon fiber. There will be 3 layers of 45/45 Soller sleeve, as well as one layer of 0 90 fabric roll wrapped around the tube, in order to better resist bending loads, which have killed similar flights in the end. It will be laid up on the liner itself with a layer of release, and I will bond the liner in afterwards (much easier to get correct case dims this way). The nozzle is potted in with InfinityBond EP420, this time using a syringe to inject the epoxy as I struggled with that on the previous motor. The forward closure (metal forward part of the motor, w/ two O rings) has an injected joint/bond (I forgot the proper term). My bond prep will be the same as usual, acetone - > IPA - > sand at 150 - > IPA again -> water break test.

The motor geometry is the same, just was slightly eviler to become more manufacturable. There are 4" motors with a smaller nozzle than this motor. 

### Nosecone
![01 - Nosecone.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTAyMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--76cd9066fba1058ae783c5d7d8cad7f76cd804b7/01%20-%20Nosecone.png)

The nosecone is kinda dead simple, just a lot of layers (6), and compression molded. The mold will use Partall mold release wax on the female part, and a silicone mold release layer (condom, just trust me bro) on the male part, which I have had used before for similar nosecones in the past. 

The ablative will be the trowelable ablative mentioned earlier, just at a different mix ratio than in the patent in order to make it more workable. 

### Avionics Bay

![02 - Avionics Bay(2).png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTAyNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c70e13d23b16250665c6f8e0264c4ecdf81adc7e/02%20-%20Avionics%20Bay(2).png)

The avionics bay has a small frustrum where the G10 plate mounts to in order to have a nice taper interface for the nosecone tip, so that the nosecone tip does not flex at all. (very important, fast rocket + slop = folded fast rocket) 

I'm mounting a Blue Raven and Featherweight GPS tracker and two batteries on the G10 plate. When the avionics bay is finalized, I will create some wiring diagrams.

### Fins

![04 - Fins.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTAyNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--db79110415bb727f8e2b9651e02832174760ac5d/04%20-%20Fins.png)

The fins are 4mm carbon fiber with XX phenolic leading edges. They'll be beveled on a table saw like stated before, and the slot in the phenolic will be machined on a manual mill. Hopefully this works, I haven't tried it before. 

### Recovery

I changed from a chute cannon setup to a cable cutter setup. The main will be on a riser and will be exposed to the airflow the whole time and ziptied shut. When the cable cutter fires the ziptie is cut and the main unfurls. This is worse than chute cannon in many ways, but I am familiar with it and it makes more sense for my rocket configuration.
  

## 10/31/2025 - Avionics & Prepared project for shipping :)  

I added the batteries and O rings to the avionics bay. I may make the frustum longer in order to better spread out any bending load applied to the nosecone tip. Mach 4 is scary dawg.

![02 - Avionics Bay(6)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzMzNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a65790b73ae5a852afd2cede9e2e6e6ba92f0ca4/02%20-%20Avionics%20Bay(6).png)

I also made a wiring diagram for the avionics bay. 

![SOTSAvionics](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzMzNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--571e46227ca23b46b54ed6c99f3731bf9d9e6594/SOTSAvionics.png)

The Blue Raven has a weird common ground for charges, which is frustrating for wiring, but with a soldering iron it should be no big deal at all. 

On the cable cutter, I'm also attaching another charge which is designed to blow the rocket apart in case the first charge fails. I read about it on a rocketry forum and it is a nice last chance measure so that rocket doesn't go ballistic. 

Something else I'm considering is G11 fins with no phenolic leading edges. I've heard people have pushed G11 much harder than it has any right to be pushed and it doesn't delaminate. It would be a nice way to save some money and time. 


As for the github repo, I uploaded the CAD, the BOM, Wiring Diagram pictures, made the readme clearer, and made sure it met the requirements for shipping.
