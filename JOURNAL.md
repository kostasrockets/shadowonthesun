## 10/20/2025 8 PM - Static Fire  

Before I created this project on Hack Club, I already worked on this project quite a bit. I designed and built a 2" composite case based off of @tsbooska on TRF's Black Stallion design. ![586867-52866e784e52bdfc78d7e0ba7ca3a7c5.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzkyNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--43c4a77de9916b7c7cbf338fccdf45cd0e2386ba/586867-52866e784e52bdfc78d7e0ba7ca3a7c5.png)

I calculated the hoop stress and epoxy bond lengths, and settled on 4 layers of carbon fiber sleeve. It has a safety factor of 3.67 on both ends

^ Casing Design Spreadsheet

I laid up the casing using molds that would fit into the phenolic motor liner, and put a layer of peel ply over the layup.

^ Casing Layups

I bonded fins to this rocket with the intent of flying it, but after bonding the nozzle and forward closure, didn't feel safe flying it. 

I fired it this saturday, and had a succesful firing. I cut it in half today and saw all the internals, what a cool IRL section view.

I could easily write ~500 words about this motor, and I'll likely elaborate on it in future journal entries. If anyone reading has any questions, my discord is 'onshape', feel free to ask.
  

## 10/20/2025 9 PM - Simulations (just the start)  

I started doing some simulations on the rocket. (again before I created the project)

Did some preliminary motor design based off of other PropX motors that have worked. Knowing what I've learned from the previous composite case and what has worked + prior art, I defined my requirements as such:

1. Short burn time
2. High average thrust 
3. Reasonable mass flux
4. Reasonable pressure (~800psi)
5. Descending mass flux with grains (I actually forgot why to do this, something about erosivity)
6. Core sizes = drill sizes

I settled on this design:

The motor is a monolithic conical geometry, with all the ends being inhibited with epoxy or urethane adhesive. (I will figure this out with some more research)

I did a first sim in OpenRocket, which is somewhat accurate at supersonic, but not great.

I then did a sim with RASAERO, which resulted in slightly higher Mach but lower Altitude than OpenRocket.

Additionally, with RASAERO, I determined the CNalpha of the rocket, which is an important (but rather arbitrary) measure of stability. Keeping it >10 has never failed me in past flights

In these preliminary sims, I have a vehicle mass fraction of 55%, and with some spicier motor configs, I get it to 67%.
